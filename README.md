# ReadMe Generator

## Description
This project is intended to create a generator that builds a high-quality readme file through the terminal using Node.js 


Every good project needs a quality README with information about the app - what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project.

checkout the <a> newREADME.md </a> in this repo as an example of what the project creates!

## Installation
To generate your own README, git clone the repo down to your local so you have the Node project on your local.

The application will start by running node index.js in the command line.

Answer the prompts in your command line to generate the README.

After answering all the prompts, your README file will be named 'newReadME.md' and will be ready for you at the root of the repo.

The README has some automatically generated badges for your repo courtesy of shields.io and will include your profile picture & email from GitHub.
